## ProKickballer.com
This is a passion project. I am the world's first professional kickball player. I managed an adult kickball league for [WAKA](http://bit.ly/2Z3kKuw). I created this application so that players and fans. It's ESPN.com for kickball. Users will be able to see match scores and match status in real-time.
This project was bootstrapped with [Java Spring](http://bit.ly/2U7LC98).

The is the front end of the app is a [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and may be used with the [Express](http://bit.ly/2YnxYln) or [Java Spring](http://bit.ly/2Z1VZyT) backend. The Express backend is further along than the Java Spring backend at the moment. This is the repo for the Java Spring backend.

### `Tech Used`
Other than the Java and Spring, you may find the following tools used in this repo:
- bcrypt: encrypt strings, specifically passwords
- Spring Web: to bootstrap a web app
- Spring Mongodb: to persist data, database
- Spring Security: to manage authentication/authorization

### `Current Status`
